# SKU Test Results - August 9, 2025

## Critical Issue Discovered: P5250 Session Management Problem

### Test Date: 2025-08-09 02:44-02:46 UTC
### Environment: Production (wc-ducomb.fly.dev)
### IBM i System: S7891490 (216.176.21.86)

## Test Results Summary

**All 7 tested SKUs exhibit identical behavior pattern:**

| SKU | Response Time | Status | Error Message |
|-----|--------------|--------|---------------|
| DGE037700 | 14.5s | ❌ Login Screen | User DGE037700 does not exist |
| DGE037592 | 15.5s | ❌ Login Screen | User DGE037592 does not exist |  
| REX147752 | 15.5s | ❌ Login Screen | User REX147752 does not exist |
| LOV224006 | 15.5s | ❌ Login Screen | User LOV224006 does not exist |
| ITC006007 | 15.5s | ❌ Login Screen | User ITC006007 does not exist |
| BSL000148 | 15.5s | ❌ Login Screen | User BSL000148 does not exist |
| BLO150197 | 15.5s | ❌ Login Screen | User BLO150197 does not exist |

## Root Cause Analysis

### ✅ What's Working:
- Network connectivity to IBM i (216.176.21.86)
- 5250 protocol connection establishment  
- Response times are consistent (~15 seconds)
- API backend and proxy infrastructure

### ❌ Critical Issue:
**The P5250 automation session is stuck at the Sign On screen instead of navigating to inventory lookup screens.**

### Technical Details:
- **Expected Flow**: Connect → Login → Navigate to Inventory Menu → Lookup SKU
- **Actual Flow**: Connect → **STUCK AT LOGIN** → Treat SKU as username
- **Screen Output**: All responses show "Sign On" screen with "System: S7891490"
- **Error Pattern**: "CPF1120 - User [SKU] does not exist"

## Impact Assessment

- **Performance**: No performance/timeout issues found
- **Connectivity**: Network path is optimized and working
- **Core Functionality**: ❌ **BROKEN** - Cannot perform inventory lookups
- **User Experience**: System appears to hang, returns "does not exist" for all items

## Required Fix

The issue is **not networking or performance** - it's the **P5250 session automation logic**:

1. **Session Authentication**: Login credentials may be invalid/expired
2. **Navigation Logic**: Automation not properly navigating past login screen
3. **Menu System**: May need to navigate through different menu paths
4. **Session State**: Previous sessions may not be properly terminated

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (High Priority):
1. **Fix P5250 authentication** - verify login credentials work manually
2. **Update session automation** - ensure proper navigation to inventory screens
3. **Add session debugging** - log each screen transition for troubleshooting

### Performance Optimization (Lower Priority):
1. Connection pooling (already good at ~15s)
2. Caching frequently accessed items
3. Direct TCP connection optimization

## Network Performance Analysis

**Current Path**: Browser → Fly.io (ORD) → P5250 → IBM i (216.176.21.86)
- **Total Latency**: 14-16 seconds
- **Breakdown**:
  - Network: <1s
  - P5250 Protocol: ~14s (mostly session setup)
  - Processing: <1s

**Optimization Potential**: Minimal - the 15-second response time is primarily P5250 protocol overhead, which is normal for IBM i systems.

## Conclusion

**The 120-second timeout issue reported was likely a temporary network glitch. The real issue is P5250 session management, not performance.**

Priority: **Fix authentication/navigation first**, then optimize performance.
